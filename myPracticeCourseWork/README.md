# Directory containing my examples

**NOTE**

When you fork your repository, you should put all of your exercises in separate maven projects in this folder. 
Make changes here and NOT in the class examples.
This will allow you to merge later class examples into your repository.
You can copy the session material into this repo and add / modify these sessions here.
You can also update your personal learning record as in this folder.
